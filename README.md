# SortVis
Visualisation of sorting algorithms

Creates an array of 10 random noon-repeating integers, and applies a sorting algorithm to them, capturing the state of the array at every step, and visualising the results in a way which allows the user to single-step through each stage.

### Currently implemented
Bubble Sort
Count Sort
Heap Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Selection Sort
Shell Sort

### Limitations
Currently unable to visualise arrays with repeating elements (although each sorting algorithm handles them fine)
